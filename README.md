# EEG-Data-GUI

This repo contains a GUI for displaying EEG signal Data obtained from the Emotic Epoc+ containing 14 Channels.

The code **gui.py** uses randomized data in the range of 4100-4300 (range of signal data obtained from the headset while testing). The images **b*.png** are the actions classified by the CNN-based classifier taking EEG data as input. The  images **t*.png** are the actions performed by the user wearing the headset in order to make the classifier classify the desired action. This was a part of a project named *"Armoid"* where a brain controlled robotic arm was made.
